Awesome Papers
--------------

Papers and implementations of papers that could have use in robotics. Implementations here may not be actively developed. While implementations may often be the author's original implementation, that isn't always the case.

- [rpg_open_remode](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_open_remode) - This repository contains an implementation of REMODE ([REgularized MOnocular Depth Estimation](http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/docs/ICRA14_Pizzoli.pdf)).
- [shelhamer/fcn.berkeleyvision.org](https://github.com/shelhamer/fcn.berkeleyvision.org) - Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation, [PAMI FCN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06211) and [CVPR FCN](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/html/Long_Fully_Convolutional_Networks_2015_CVPR_paper.html)
- [train-CRF-RNN](https://github.com/martinkersner/train-CRF-RNN) - Training scripts for [CRF-RNN for Semantic Image Segmentation](https://github.com/torrvision/crfasrnn).
- [train-DeepLab](https://github.com/martinkersner/train-DeepLab) - This repository contains scripts for training [DeepLab for Semantic Image Segmentation](https://bitbucket.org/deeplab/deeplab-public) using [strongly](https://github.com/martinkersner/train-DeepLab#strong-annotations) and [weakly annotated data](https://github.com/martinkersner/train-DeepLab#weak-annotations). [Semantic Image Segmentation with Deep Convolutional Nets and Fully Connected CRFs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7062) and [Weakly- and Semi-Supervised Learning of a DCNN for Semantic Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02734) papers describe training procedure using strongly and weakly annotated data, respectively.
